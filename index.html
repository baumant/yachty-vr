      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>Opens in a forest with tall trees. Before the music starts Yachty is standing alone. As the rapping starts, multiple Yachties, wearing all camo, begin to agressively run out from behind him ad-libbing and rapping “gang, gang” etc. then disappear back behind him. Think Kanye's verse in "Mercy."</p>
      <p>The initial Yachty begins to walk around as he raps. As he walks and raps, the camo Yachties will subtly pop out from behind trees in the background and and follows the initial Yachty.</p>
      <p>e.g.  from behind a tree in the background, in all camo, Yachty bursts out on an atv. As the Yachty in the foreground raps a smaller Yachty follows follows him moving faster. </p>
      <p>Throughout the video Yachties will continue to pop out in the background behind the main Lil Yachty, so as we follow him in VR we will be greeted by versions of Lil Yachty that blend in, creating a game of "¿where's Yachty?" for the viewers. </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>Since the video will more or less be a one-shot (we can't really cut Yachty because the camera is stationary and you will see the cut points) throughout the video we can bring the Yachties in and out by having him come out from behind trees and other, closer Yachties without hard cuts and without spending too much time masking.</p>

      <h3>Lighting</h3>
      <p>The video will be shot at night with a spotlight light pointing at our subject. This will eliminate the sunlight factor because shooting multiple takes will take a long time<br>🕐🕑🕒🕓🕕🕕🕗</p>
