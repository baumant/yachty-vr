      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>The video opens in a forest with tall trees. Before the music starts, Yachty is standing alone. As the rapping  starts, multiple Yachties begin to aggressively run out from behind him ad-libbing and rapping. “Gang, gang” etc. Think Kanye's verse in "Mercy"</p>
      <p>The initial Yachty stays in place.</p>
      <p>As the song progresses, the scene becomes more and more filled. Giant objects fall from the sky: money stacks, fisher price toys, a painting lands on a tree and burst into flames later on, a car. Once the objects are in place they'll cause a chain reaction that the viewer can follow around the scene. See these examples... </p><iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXrRC3pfLnE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>When the song comes to an end all the Yachties retreat back behind the 1st Yachty and behind the trees etc., leaving Yachty standing alone once again. The debris from the video stays in place.</p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>Since the video will more or less be a one-shot (we can't really cut Yachty because the camera is stationary and you will see the cut points) throughout the video we can bring the Yachties in and out by having him come out from behind trees and other, closer Yachties without hard cuts and without spending too much time masking. </p>
      <p>note: I have experience shooting with the gear VR. We just wrapped a music video that used that camera.  </p>

      <h3>Other References</h3>
      <p>YJ will be the only constant throughout the video. he raps and moves forward through the scenes on his own. however virtually every other object in every scene, including drunk bf, is interactive to the user. the user sort of plays god in that they can move every object around via click and drag. </p><iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-b6xIXC7_U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
